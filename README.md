# Venn-Bot
The new and only 21st century Discord Bot users need!


Hello! and welcome to Venn Bot! Venn Bot is a small Discord bot planning on being grown by its one and only developer (the one writing this to you!), 0x69. I am dedicating this bot to all newbie discord users to join the fun of learning discord.js bot development together!

# Information

Although, this bot is small currently, but I have a goal of helping out complete newbies with this project AND, not only that, but gradually over time, I am planning to make this a universal bot that can do almost any thing on discord FOR FREE! I do not belive that projects dedicated towards helping out the community should have to be paid (no offense paid bot developers) such as Rover, Bloxlink, Dyno, Carl-Bot, so on and so forth. The current commands are: upcoming, which shows the upcoming and planned bot commands for the upcoming update, help, and invite.
